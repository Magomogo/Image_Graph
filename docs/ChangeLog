 Image_Graph - Changelog
*************************
Version 0.3.0dev2 [XX] - Jesper Veggerby <pear.nosey@veggerby.dk>
    * Added functionality for multi-level labels (ticks, text, etc.) to support for minor and major labels (and more if needed)
    * Fixed bug causing displayErrors() to generate WARNING and FATAL ERROR
    * Fixed problems with gradient fills (did not display propery using GD drivers)
    * Changed while-list-each to foreach for performance reasons (minor)
    * Added fontmapping in GD drivers useful for mapping mnemonic fontnames, i.e. Times New Roman to font file names (either partial or full)
    * Added configuration option in Config.php (IMAGE_GRAPH_SYSTEM_FONT_PATH) enabling to specify default search path for system fonts
        - On Windows systems this defaults to %SYSTEMROOT%\Fonts\
    * Added 'auto' split on layouts - calculated automatically based on actual sizes of the parts (supported only with titles)
    * Added visual tests - not PHPUnit, test cases:
        - Driver support for gradients
        - Text output alignment

Version 0.3.0dev2 (pre-release #3) [2004-Dec-08] - Jesper Veggerby <pear.nosey@veggerby.dk>
    * Added drivers for GD subtypes GIF and WBMP
    * Added drivers for SWF (MING) and PDF (PDFlib) - initial stage
    * Added support for setting width on the bars in a bar chart
    * Added setFontColor(), setFontSize(), setFontAngle() to elements for easy change of properties of propagating fonts, without needing to create a new object
    * Fonts now propagate through the structure, meaning if you set a font on the Graph all other elements inherit this font (but can be overridden)
        - This does *not* break BC
    * Changed Image_Graph_Title constructor slightly (second parameter, see Docs. for details)
    * Changed Image_Graph_Axis::setTitle() slightly to accomodate propagating fonts (no BC break)
    * Removed GLOBAL font variables	
        - This is a minor BC break!
    * Fixed problem with bar-, area-, step- and impulse-charts when using forceMinimum(), causing bars to display 'below' x-axis

Version 0.3.0dev2 (pre-release #2) [2004-Nov-30] - Jesper Veggerby <pear.nosey@veggerby.dk>
    * Added support for adding an array to Image_Graph_Dataset_Trivial for easy point addition
    * Re-implemented support for line styles
    * API Change with minor impact on BC: Image_Graph_Fill now inherits from Image_Graph_Common (instead of Image_Graph_Element)
    * Changed GD driver
        - Image_Graph_Driver_GD is now abstract
        - GD formats JPEG and PNG are now separate classes, Image_Graph_Driver_GD_JPG and Image_Graph_Driver_GD_PNG
        - Driver types are now 'png' and 'jpg', specifying 'gd' will default to 'png'
    * Fixed Image_Graph_Axis::force(Minimum|Maximum)
    * Repost: Included some more aliases for the Image_Graph::factory() method

Version 0.3.0dev2 (pre-release) [2004-Nov-25] - Jesper Veggerby <pear.nosey@veggerby.dk>

        - Drivers planned SVG (XML_SVG), PDF (File_PDF + PDFlib) and SWF (MING + libswf)
        - No BC breaking API changes
        - Currently no support for animations, i.e. SVG and SWF
    * Modified Image_Graph_Axis_Radar to be a category axis
    * Modified Image_Graph_Dataset to allow for y-value to be an array of values (to support candlestick diagrams)
    * Changed pie chart legends, so they show all data values as legend except just one for complete chart
    * Changed logging behaviour (added Image_Graph::setLog() method)
    * Updated how bar charts calculate width
    * Legends now scale properly	
    * Legends now show differently depending on plot type
    * API Changes with minor impact on BC

        - Removed Image_Graph::saveAs(), functionality moved to Image_Graph_Driver::done() method
        - Removed Image_Graph::thumbnail()
        - Removed Image_Graph_Axis_Multidimensional, mainly for perfomance reasons
    * Added some error/insanity checks
    * Fixed problems with Image_Graph_Axis_Radar showing values in wrong order
    * Fixed bug causing negative bars to display incorrecly (why o' why is 0 == 'some string'?)
    * Fixed bug causing setLineStyle() to fail
    * Fixed Bug #2684 "Source typo breaking data selectors"
    * Fixed Bug #2685 "Plots do not honor ID tags for fills"

Version 0.3.0dev1 [2004-Oct-25] - Jesper Veggerby <pear.nosey@veggerby.dk>
    * First PEAR version - GraPHPite changes to Image_Graph
    * Changed Image_Graph_Axis_Sequential to Image_Graph_Axis_Category
    * Changed default X-axis to be Image_Graph_Axis_Category
    * Changed all plot types to be stackable
        - This implies removing Image_Graph_Plot_Stacked_Bar, Image_Graph_Plot_Stacked_Bar100Pct, Image_Graph_Plot_Stacked_Area, Image_Graph_Plot_MultipleData
        - Modified the way axis handling is done - no user impact
    * Removed Image_Graph_Plot_Bar_Horizontal
    * Modified management of axis maxima
    * Removed Image_Graph_Text completely, replaced by Image_Graph_Element::write() - performance improvement
    * Added possibility to draw graph on an existing image
    * Added caching capability
    * Added Image_Graph_Axis_Marker_Area and Image_Graph_Axis_Marker_Line
    * Added marks to axis (a value marker, i.e. an arrow or a ranged box)
    * Fixed bug where stacked / multiple charts containing all zeros in datasets did not display or gave a division by zero error in Axis.php
    * Modified Image_Graph_Fill_Gradient for better performance
    * Added Image_Graph::factory and Image_Graph::layoutFactory methods, mainly for lazy include
    * Removed Include.php, use either factory methods or include necessary files manually
    * Added Image_Graph_Simple for very simple creation of graphs
    * Added secondary y-axis
    * Changed internal color scheme to use Image_Color - user impact:
        - Image_Graph::newColor(), Image_Graph::addColor removed
        - Uses Image_Graph_Color from 'old' Image_Graph package, which statically uses Image_Graph_Color::allocateColor() and Image_Graph_Color::color2RGB()
        - Constants IMAGE_GRAPH_[COLORNAME] removed. Use string names, i.e. 'white', 'blue' as defined by Image_Color (now a dependency)
        - Standard 'string' color formats supported
    * Added internal error handler Image_Graph_Common::_error() which uses PEAR_ErrorStack and Log
    * Changed Image_Graph_Marker_PercentageCircle to Image_Graph_Marker_Bubble

    * Documentation brush up
    * Added logarithmic axis
    * Tested with PHP5
    * License changed from GPL to LGPL	
    * Changed to accomodate PEAR standards
        - All classes are now named according to PEAR naming scheme, i.e. Image_Graph_*
        - All class methods are sturdy caps i.e. Element::done(), Axis::forceMinimum()
        - Include files are now named .php instead of .inc
        - File structure changed
        - All private variables/methods are prefixed with a _ (should have no effect on usage since they are (should be!) private)
    * Axis' are now returned via the Plotarea::getAxis() method
    * Add methods now return a reference to the object, instead of the 'odd' way of creating global variables, i.e.:
            $Graph->addPlot(new Plot(), 'Plot');
        is changed to:
            $Plot =& $Graph->addPlot(new Plot());
    * Coloring scheme changed so that named colors are now linked to a 24 bit integer value instead of the objects. setFillColor, setLineColor, setBorderColor and setBackgroundColor instead of the corresponding -Style, to use the named colors). The colors are named according to the PEAR naming scheme: IMAGE_GRAPH_[COLOR], fx  IMAGE_GRAPH_RED
    * Included (a few) examples in the distribution

    * Added a secondary Marker to the Marker class to allow for multiple/'nested' markers
    * Added global variable DEFAULT_VERTICAL_FONT (which is an instance of VerticalFont)
