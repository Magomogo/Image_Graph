Introduction:
-------------
I really hope you enjoy Image_Graph and may find it useful whereever you
might wish to visualize numerical data. With it you can draw graphs into a
coordinate system. You have the choice between bar- or line-visualisation of
your data, and may even invent your own data-elements. The basic visualisation
can then be greatly enhanced by the (careful) use of datamarkers, by doing fills
(maybe try out a gradient fill inside a bar ...) or a by using the grid.


Documentation, tutorials etc.:
------------------------------
Documentation for this package can be found in the official PEAR manual at:
http://pear.php.net/manual/

API-docs in "conventional" style can be found at:
http://pear.speedpartner.de/
There you will also find PNG-files of the examples shipped with the package.

Have a look at the examples which you find in docs/examples/. Together with the
API-reference they serve as the only tutorials available - sorry. But at the
present step I mainly concentrate on the development and improvement of the
functionality.

  +++ Hey, maybe somebody of you volunteers to write a "visual testsuite"
      for the package? If you're interested, please leave me a message. +++


Note about flexibility and API-design:
--------------------------------------
The design of all APIs was written done with flexibility and extendability
in mind. However, please understand that in such a large project you
can't plan every detail that might become useful one day. Be asured that we
will try our best to keep the API consistent about the next releases. But
please note that this package is still heavily under development and therefor
the API might be changed in some ways (hopefully only extended). Please have
a look at the release-notes to keep informed of all important changes.
