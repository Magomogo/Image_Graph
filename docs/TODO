What will be next?
------------------
Well, there are already many plans for the next time. These include:

 - image-maps
 - extensive support for bitmaps (for usage as backgrounds, fill-elements etc.)
 - implement new fill-elements (maybe radial fill, bitmap-fill, ...)
 - 3D-bars, shadows etc.
 - curves (as a "smooth" alternative to the current data-element "line")
 - a legend
 - support for PHP-internal bitmap-fonts (so that users are not forced
   to have the FreeType-library available; however this is strongly recommended)
 - numerical x-axis and logarithmic y-axis
 - integration of SVG- and PIMP-output functions
 

If you would like to help working on any of these ideas or have more good ideas to
add to our list, simply leave me a message.
