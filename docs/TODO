********************
 Image_Graph - TODO
********************

Image_Graph
*** Update private tags to protected wherever necessary
*** Create a simple table element
*** Create bar-chart-type where bar have individual widths (i.e. in the dataset fx)

Image_Graph_Element
*** Look at further optimization (line 384) (sample20.php = 416 calls!)

Image_Graph_Legend
*** Possibility to wrap legend titles

Image_Graph_Plot
*** Create a method for making legend samples user defined

Image_Graph_Plot_BoxWhisker
*** Possibility to handle outliers (see http://pear.veggerby.dk/forum/read.php?board=1&id=265)

Image_Graph_Plot_Line
*** Consider new legend icon

Image_Graph_Plot_Pie
*** Group items together i one pie ("the rest") if less than a certain value/percentage

Image_Graph_Plot_Smoothed_Radar
*** Create legend sample for smoothed radar chart

Image_Graph_Axis
*** Implement axis as having an angle instead of hardcoded Y = 90, X = 0 degrees
*** Create a method to align '0' of primary and secondary y-axis
*** Values aren't properly cropped when "above" maximum or "below" minimum (i.e. graph should be cropped to plotarea!)

Image_Graph_Axis_Composite
*** Implement composite axis (i.e. linear from 0-10, log from 10-1000, and category from 1001, 1004, 10000, ...)

Image_Graph_Axis_Logarithmic
*** Implement logarithic axis minimum (other that 0)

Image_Graph_Axis_Marker
*** Implement a label mechanism when using axis markers

Image_Graph_Driver
*** Implement image maps

Image_Graph_Driver_GD
*** Make a better method for "baseline" adjustment (line 1260)

Image_Graph_Driver_LibSWF
*** Create LibSWF support

Image_Graph_Driver_SVG
*** Linestyles (i.e. fx. dotted) does not work
*** Make images work in SVG
*** Pieslices with v2-v1 < 90 "curl" the wrong way

Image_Graph_Driver_SWF
*** I don't get SWF gradient fill: moveTo/scaleTo/rotateTo
*** Image fill SWF doesn't seem to work even with JPEG's
*** Implement SWF::overlayImage
*** Implement SWF::pieSlice
*** Implement SWF::textHeight
*** Implement SWF::textWidth
*** Implement SWF::write
*** Scale the image fill in SWF
*** SWF curve smoothing requires only one control point - this method is not very good!

Image_Graph_Driver_PDFlib
*** Implement Image_Driver_PDF::pieslice()
*** Implement linestyles in PDFlib (using pdf_setcolor(.., 'pattern'...); ?

Image_Graph_Driver_XMLSVG
*** Gradient fill's does not seem to be supported by XML_SVG, investigate

Image_Graph_Dataset_Function
*** Implement algorithm for "best-select" of points, i.e $points = "auto"
